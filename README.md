# goughlab_data_mgmt

This repository will house all things data management for the gough lab. 
Primarily, we will use this to collaborate on an RMarkdown document that describes the data mgmt/ data workflow for lab related research projects. 

Some ideas include:
+ Using git version control for your R project
+ Using googledrive R package to upload "clean" data to fortedata shared google drive 
+ How to download and ingest LICOR files 
+ Standard data structure guidelines
