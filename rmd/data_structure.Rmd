# General Data Format and Preparation

This section summarizes general formatting and preparation guidelines for all data
shared and uploaded to fortedata. 

## Naming files and folders

1. Names should be lowercase with "_" separating words.
2. File Type: CSV (Comma delimited)
3. Filenames: "data_type_year.csv" (i.e. "canopy_dendroband_2019.csv")
4. Folder Names: "data_type" (i.e. "canopy_dendroband")
5. README.txt file included in every folder (see README.txt file structure)
5. Each year should be 1 data file (but does this make sense for instrument data?)

## General File Structure and Format

1. Each row is one observation
2. Column names should:
+ Be lowercase with "_" separating words 
+ Include units if quantitative (i.e. "DBH_cm"; Flux units excluded)
+ Be added to `forte_table_metadata.csv` (if not already listed)
3. Required columns:
+ subplot_id -- replicate ("A-") plot ("-01-") subplot ("-E") (i.e "A01E");**SHOULD NOT** include separate replicate, plot, and subplot columns
+ date -- Date of data collection (YYYY-MM-DD)
+ notes
